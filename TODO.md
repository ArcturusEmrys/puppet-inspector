 * Render to texture
   * Display texture to window for chroma keying
   * Spout2 and PipeWire for Windows and Linux
   * ...OpenGL will fucking croak if you try this.
     * So let's use our WGPU renderer!
       * ...but GTK doesn't let you draw to surfaces
         * ~~We can draw textures but we need to ferry them from a headless WGPU renderer~~
           * ...not on Windows! Or Apple! (See the note about zero-copy GPU transforms)
           * Also, at least on Linux, we can't actually be zero-copy or we can't clear the texture!!!
         * ~~our WGPU renderer is designed to draw and present to a surface, which GTK doesn't like~~
         * So we need WGPU rendering to support headless (no target surface) mode
           * ~~First we need to get rid of the hard dependency on a target~~
           * We'll have an architecture of two renderers
           * One to feed StageRendererWidget, one to render the stage texture
           * They need to share as many resources as possible
           * Ideally they should live in separate threads
           * We need Arc ownership of basically everything
         * Figure out if we can make use of that GTK graphics offload thing
         * Ideally we'd have some kind of GTK widget that provides a configured WGPU adapter
         * We need a low-level framework for zero-copy GPU memory transforms
           * ~~Use DMABUF on Linux, that can be pumped to GDK AND PipeWire~~
           * Windows will require something different, probably DX12 shaped
           * Apple platforms want to use IOSurface to move memory between APIs
